# Plant Inoculation, Growth, and Nodulation 

## Seed Inoculation (optional)
1. Grow 3-4 YM plate lawns of *Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens*.  
  * The manitol in the YM media should allow for the bacteria to adhere better to the seed coat, and acts as a carbon source      for the bacteria

2. After lawn is grown up, asceptically add 10 mL of YM liquid media and scrape off culture (without breaking the agar), and add to a sterile beaker

3. Repeat this process, adding another 10 mL to the plate, and wash off any extra culture that might remain. Add this to the previous beaker. You should have approximately 20 mL per plate from this

4. Repeat for each plate. Add all to one beaker labeled Soaking Beaker

5. Soak 64 sterilized soybean seeds in this liquid culture for an hour, in the beaker

6. Remove seeds from solution by covering another beaker with a cheesecloth or gauze, and pouring out the Soaking Beaker into it (all seeds should be caught on the fabric)

7. Use hands or tweezers to remove the seeds - immediately plant into soaked vermiculite

## Flood Inoculation 
1. Grow 3-4 YM plate lawns of *Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens*.

2. After lawn is grown up, asceptically add 10 mL of the bacteriological saline solution and scrape of off the culture from the plate, and add to a sterile beaker

3. Repeat this process, adding another 10 mL to the plate, and wash off any extra culture on the plate. Add this to the previous beaker used. You should have approximately 20 mL per plate from this

4. Repeat for each plate. Add all to one beaker labeled Flooding Solution

5. Use a sterile large syringe (60 ml) and add droplets (~ 5mL) to the root area of all the seedlings

6. Try to concentrate this to directly above the roots. Does not need to be sterile. 

7. Place seedlings back into the incubator.

## Seed Sterilization 
1. Place seeds in 50mL falcon tube 

2. Immerse in 0.1% Trixton X-100 for 2 minutes

3. Decant into a waste beaker

4. Immerse in 70% Ethanol for 2 minutes

5. Decant into waste beaker 

6. Rinse 3 times with DI H2O


## Germinating and Planting the Seeds
1. After seed sterilization, wrap moist seeds on a paper towel and place in a plastic bag (a ziplock, for example) and leave for two days. 
* Check the seeds after the first 24 hours, and observe if germination has taken place. 
2. After 2 days, or once you see sprouting from the seeds, plant in prepared pots.
* (To prepare planting) Fill each pot with vermiculite, almost to the top

3. Water the vermiculite with warm water, the aim here is to soak it until it becomes x5-x7 times heavier than it was before. This is not-quantitative, and does not need to be precisely measured.
* Ensure that: the water is warm, and that you don't oversoak. This part is a little weird, because it's a bit by feeling. 

4. Lightly water the pots with cold water, so that the top of the vermiculite is luke-warm to the touch. 
* Try not to oversoak the vermiculite.

5. Push three holes into the vermiculate that are one inch deep and equidistant from each other.
* You can use a pencil 
* Each hole should be 1/2 inch - 1 inch in depth. The point of using the pencil is that the sharpened part of the pencil should be about that long. The holes don't have to be perfectly separate, but just far apart enough that if each seed added to the hole was to germinate, the root systems wouldn't entangle.

6. Add 3 seeds per pot. Add one seed to each hole, and wait for 5 days. Place in the incubator. 

## Care for Plants and Bacterial Treatment 
* (optional) after shoots show, flood with bacterial inoculum.
* Remove any underdeveloped shoots, always leaving one growing plant in the pots.
* If the vermiculite is moist to the touch, even after two days, do not re-water. 
* Immedietly water if the vermiculite is dry, even if the two days haven't passed. 

1. The plants should be watered once the top of the vermiculite is drier to the touch, on the top
 * Water with DI water 
2. Fill a watering can with DI water, and topically apply to the plants.
