# Evaluation of toxin tolerance by MIC assay

We have determined the toxicity of linuron and 3,4-DCA toward *B. diazoefficiens* using growth curve MIC experiments, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 24.01 and 20.82 µM respectively. These values confirm that linuon is indeed toxic to *B. diazoefficiens* at agriculturally-relevant concentrations (Fernandez-Pascual, 1988), demostrating the need for a more tolerant engineered organism. The collected toxicity data also provides benchmarks against which to compare the performance of any future engineered strains.

We have also shown that *E. coli* DH5α is not inhibited by linuron concentrations up to 290 µM, linuron’s solubility limit, and that it is also not inhibited by 3,4-DCA concentrations up to 226 µM, with some inhibition occuring above this concentration. We have also demonstrated that LibA and NAT1 genes in the pRJPaph-GFP vector do not impose a metabolic burden on DH5α compared to the empty vector alone. However, LibA and NAT1 do not lend increase tolerance to LibA or NAT1 versus the empty vector in *E. coli*. This does not necessarily mean that our system doesn't work as genes were optimized for expression in *B. diazoefficiens*, not *E. coli*.
