# Toxicology Studies 

In our project, we worked to metabolize the pesticide linuron. We felt that it was important to complete a thorough risk assessment of the compounds **linuron, 3,4-DCA, and acetyl-3,4-DCA**. These molecules are created and/or consumed during the degradation of linuron. Through this analysis, we gained a deeper understanding of the hazards of these compounds, determined safe limits and exposure routes, and ultimately provided concentration targets and best practices for wet lab experimentation and implementation.
The compounds were assessed along the following dimensions: **_Use and Environmental Exposure, Occupational Exposure and Exposure Limits, Global Persistence Potential, and Health Effects_**.

### Use and Environmental Exposure 

Linuron is a urea-based herbicide that users must register in order to apply to their crops.<sup>2</sup> It is often used in combination with other herbicides in order to control a wider variety of pests, and can be used as a broadcast or directed spray on agricultural crops, where the rate of its application can be anywhere between 0.20 to 4.50 kg a.i./ha.<sup>2</sup>

However, after re-evaluation of linuron by Health Canada’s _Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA)_ in 2012, it has been proposed to phase out the use of this herbicide in Canada due to human health and environmental risk estimations.<sup>3</sup>

### Occupational Exposure and Exposure Limits 

Workers using linuron or workers that are involved in the production of linuron can be exposed to this chemical through inhalation, dermal contact, and contact with the soil/vegetation that linuron is sprayed on.<sup>4</sup> However, when used as an herbicide, toxic concentrations are variable depending on the type of crop it is being used on.<sup>4</sup>

### Global Persistence Potential

In soil, linuron degrades simultaneously with other compounds and, at normal application rates, will take 3 to 4 months to degrade.<sup>2</sup> As such, it is moderately persistent in soil, particularly clay, and therefore does not move freely.<sup>2</sup> The more organic content there is in the soil, the lower the mobility of linuron, therefore hindering its ability to act as an herbicide.<sup>2</sup> 

In water, linuron is moderately soluble and is not readily broken down.<sup>2</sup> However, the residue from this chemical in the form of runoff results in the bioconcentration of linuron in bluegill fish and orange-red killifish.<sup>2</sup> Based on data from Cornell’s EXTOXNET, the bioconcentration levels of linuron are referred to be low/moderate.<sup>2</sup>

### Health Effects 

Linuron has a Cancer Classification of Group C - Possible Human Carcinogen.<sup>1</sup> This is due to there being no human carcinogenicity data on this chemical, with limited evidence on animal carcinogenicity.<sup>1</sup> Studies have shown the production of benign tumours in the form of testicular hyperplasia and adenomas for male rats, as well as hepatocellular adenomas in female mice.<sup>1</sup> 

In addition, human lymphocytes exposed in vitro to 1 ug/ml of linuron causes little chromosome damage.<sup>1</sup> However, a mixture of 0.5 ug/ml linuron and 0.0005 ug/ml atrazine (another type of herbicide), showed more significant chromosomal damage.<sup>1</sup>

___

## 3,4-DCA Dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA)

(INSERT CHEMDRAW IMAGE HERE)
Image sourced from Toxnet <sup> 1 </sup> 

### Use and Environmental Exposure 

3,4-DCA is primarily used as a chemical intermediate for dyes and pesticides.6 Environment and Climate Change Canada conducted an extensive screening process of this chemical and determined that these substances were not Toxic Substances.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, no intentional and direct uses of 3,4-DCA were identified in Canada.<sup>6</sup>  

### Occupational Exposure and Exposure Limits 

Exposure likely occurs via inhalation, ingestion (via drinking water) or dermal contact from the degradation of dyes and pesticides.<sup>6</sup> Dietary exposure is very low due to the low allowable limit of said pesticides.<sup>6</sup> Due to the limited uses of 3,4-DCCA, occupational exposure limits are not listed as exposures are very low.<sup>5</sup> Typical exposure routes include inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact.<sup>5</sup> 

### Global Persistence Potential

3,4-DCA is found to be a persistent compound in soil and water and is not expected to undergo significant degradation in these environments.<sup>5</sup> However, the vapor phase will degrade with a 17 hour half life, limiting 3,4-DCA’s potential as a globally persistent pollutant.<sup>5</sup> Toxicity is discussed in the _Health Effects_ section, however, it should be noted that the compound is very toxic to aquatic life with lasting effects.<sup>5</sup> Our project aims to lessen this effect by acetylating the compound, converting it into Acetyl-3,4-DCA.

### Health Effects

Human cancer risk was not reported, and the compound was not classified by IARC, although this may be due to its limited use.<sup>5</sup> Other health effects include severe acute dermal and oral toxicity effects and serious eye damage in animals and humans (in larger concentrations).<sup>5</sup> Animal studies found that high exposure can cause abnormal liver or kidney function and reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood with LD50 dermal contact ranging from 300-800 mg/kg.<sup>5</sup> The compound is very toxic to aquatic life with lasting effects.<sup>5</sup> 

___

## Propanil (proxy evalutaon for Acetyl-3,4-DCA)

(INSERT CHEMDRAW IMAGE HERE)
Image sourced from Toxnet <sup>1</sup> 

### Use and Environmental Exposure 

Propanil is most commonly used as a pesticide.<sup>8</sup>  Possible routes of exposure for humans include consumption via trace amounts on treated crops, in addition to inhalation and dermal contact during spraying.<sup>8</sup> 

### Occupational Exposure and Exposure Limits

Occupational exposure routes include inhalation and dermal contact at both the facilities where propanil is produced, and the fields in which it is sprayed as a pesticide.<sup>8</sup>  There is no OEL listed for propanil in Ontario workplaces under Regulation 833.<sup>8</sup> However, it is recommended that exposed employees be monitored for methemoglobinemia, which would indicate the requirement for an OEL at any workplace where an individual may be exposed to propanil.<sup>8</sup>

### Global Persistence Potential and Ecotoxicity 

Propanil is readily biodegradable with varied mobility in soil.<sup>9</sup> It is not expected to volitize from water, and bioaccumulation in aquatic life is low. Propanil is subject to photolysis via sunlight.<sup>9</sup> The half-life of propanil in the environment can range from 12 hours to 44.1 days, and as such propanil will not persist globally.<sup>9</sup> Data from animal toxicity studies indicate that some amounts of propanil can be toxic to birds, mammals, and aquatic species.<sup>9</sup>

### Health Effects

Propanil is not classified as a human carcinogen, but can be lethal if ingested.<sup>10</sup> Methemoglobinemia is a common result of exposure.<sup>10</sup> The standard treatment for propanil poisoning is methylene blue taken orally or intravenously.<sup>11</sup>

# Use of Linuron and Glyphosate in Canada

Our project focuses on the use of herbicides within the realm of Canadian agricultural practices, but mainly in soybean crop cultivation. In order to do so, we narrowed down our choices of herbicide to two different contenders; linuron and glyphosate. To learn about the regulations for each of these pesticides, we emailed Robert Martin to help us find a starting point. Robert Martin is the Regulatory Information Officer at the _Pest Management Regulatory Agency in Canada_, and he directed us to the re-evaluation notices of both linuron and glyphosate. In order to fully comprehend his detailed response, we organized the background information on both herbicides we chose. We then added the key points from his email and the re-evaluations to guide us on where to go next.

## Classification
 
Linuron is defined as “a substituted urea herbicide used to control annual and perennial broadleaf and grassy weeds on crop and non-crop sites”.<sup>12</sup> Other pesticides that are substituted urea compounds have a similar mode of action and are classified as Group 7 herbicides. Group 7 herbicides are “inhibitors of photosynthesis at photosystem II, Site B. They block electron transport and the transfer of light energy.”<sup>13</sup> At one point, linuron was a very commonly used herbicide in Canada. In 1990, 272 tonnes of linuron were sold in Canada, with 80% of it being used for fruits and vegetable crops.<sup>14</sup> As previously stated, we are specifically observing its use in soybean crops. In these crops, engineered soybeans can metabolize essentially all of the linuron added, and respective metabolites, within 83 days.<sup>14</sup>
 
Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide that will kill most plants by preventing them from making essential proteins needed for growth.<sup>15</sup> Glyphosate is classified as a Group 9 herbicide. Group 9 herbicides are amino acid derivatives that inhibit 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase). Glyphosate is the main ingredient in the commonly known herbicide, _Roundup_, and it is the most commonly used herbicide in Canada.<sup>16</sup> Glyphosate is also the world’s most commonly used herbicide.<sup>17</sup> Part of the reason we chose glyphosate as a potential herbicide of interest is due to its prevalence in Canadian and Global agriculture.

For a full review on the toxicity of both linuron and glyphosate, please refer to our Tox Studies documentation (here <-hyperlink).

We faced two problems with our choices of herbicide.
1. 	Glyphosate is currently under study for accusations on its carcinogenicity, and the adverse health risks for humans. It was subject to various re-assessments from the _International Agency for Research on Cancer_ (IARC)
2. 	Linuron is slated for re-evaluation; the proposal insisted that linuron be phased out entirely <sup>17</sup>

## Health Concerns and Review of Linuron and Glyphosate
 
In 2017, _Health Canada_ published their final re-evaluation stating that glyphosate is not genotoxic and is unlikely to pose a human cancer risk.<sup>18</sup> They also stated that the occupational and residential risks associated with its use are not of concern, if label directions are followed accurately. _Health Canada_ faced several (8) notices of objection on this decision, which is most likely due to comments made on the “carcinogenic effects” it has on humans. In a statement made in January 2019, _Health Canada_ stands by its decision because the objections were not scientifically supported.<sup>19</sup> “No pesticide regulatory authority in the world currently considers glyphosate to be a cancer risk to humans at the levels at which humans are currently exposed.”<sup>19</sup>
 
Linuron, on the other hand, remains a concern. In February 2012, a proposed re-evaluation was published by _Health Canada_ stating their intention of removing linuron from the Canadian market entirely because “under the current conditions of use, the human health and environmental risks estimated for linuron do not meet current standards”.<sup>20</sup> _Health Canada_ wants to conclude that the best course of action was to get rid of linuron, however the final decision has yet to be made.<sup>20</sup>  This decision is set to be published in February 2020.

## Conclusions
 
Completely ridding of linuron does not help our project. However, if we could successfully prove our hypothesis through the introduction of genes for linuron metabolism in _Bradyrhizobia_, our project could act as a precedent for other potential ventures focussed on herbicide metabolism in similar microorganisms by introducing transgenes.

# Scientist Interviews

While developing our project, we wanted to consult research experts in the field to better understand the regulations that guide their work, as well as their experience interacting with the general public regarding the controversy in agriculture. We were fortunate to have been able to correspond with two research scientists at _Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada_ to talk about their experience on these matters. The following sections summarize our findings from our conversations with Dr. Breanne Tidemann an Dr. Sara Martin.

### Dr. Breanne Tidemann, Research Scientist (Field Agronomy, Weed Science) 

![breanetidemann](https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/8/8a/T--Waterloo--breanetidemann.jpg)

Individuals in the agriculture community, both in research and industry understand the reasons for herbicide use. The general public needs help understanding why herbicides are important. This can be achieved through comparisons and analogies, such as comparing large-scale farming to gardening. Weeding gardens in homes by hand to keep flower beds healthy is feasible. Weeding a farmland that is thousands of times bigger than a common flower bed and contains that many weeds by hand is no longer a feasible way of dealing with weeds choking out desired plants. Furthermore, hand weeding is not a fun job; finding labour workers for it would be difficult and not economically feasible for the land owners. 

The general public has an aversion to products that have had pesticides or herbicides used on them, but they do not recognize that something being labelled “organic” does not necessarily mean “pesticide free.” Organic farming uses a different set of accepted pesticides, such as vinegar (acetic acid) or iron products. Currently organic farms produce far lower yields with their methods and are therefore infeasible to be the only methodology used for food production on a national and global scale. 

### Dr. Sara Martin, Research Scientist (Plant Systematics, Weeds and Invasive Species) 

![saramartin](https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/2/29/T--Waterloo--saramartn.jpg)

Members of the general public tend to have a negative view of herbicides and feel strongly that farmers should stop using them. However, farmers do not share this same view, as the herbicides that are currently being used in a widespread manner are being used for good reason. Often, the chemicals that could replace herbicide use are far worse for people and the environment. The agriculture industry, like all others, requires a workforce and without herbicides the labour of hand-weeding falls on a very vulnerable group of people. Weeding cannot be avoided, and they have to be removed in order to maintain ideal crop quality and yield. Historically, without herbicides the labour associated with weeding fell on women and children within the communities. Many people understand that this is historically what occurred in first world countries, but many don’t realize that this is actively occurring in third world countries. This is both economically inefficient and hard, potentially dangerous labour.

Regarding federal and provincial regulations, it was suggested to look into the Pest Management Regulatory Agency to gain insight on pesticide regulations. 

### Next Steps

Both Dr. Tidemann and Dr. Martin feel that integrated weed management is the key moving forwards within the agricultural industry. The integrated weed management strategy requires the use of chemical, physical, biological, and cultural controls to manage weeds. This strategy only works when all these factors are effectively combined, not when any of them work alone. This strategy which takes into account aspects such as tillage, narrow row spacing, and using diverse crop rotation would help farmers develop competitive crops without relying solely on herbicide and pesticide use. The strategy of integrated weed management is one that could easily include our altered _rhizobia_ to aid with crop quality maintenance and yield rates. Furthermore, Dr. Martin’s suggestion to explore the Pest Management Regulatory Agency guided our investigation outlined in the following sections.

# Herbicide Regulations

Before proceeding further, we had to determine whether or not the work we were doing was permitted under restrictions set by the provincial government. We emailed both the Minister and Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure  that our  research project complied with provincial policies. 

The _Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks_ administers the [Pesticide Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90p11) and [Regulation 63/09](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/090063), which is responsible for managing  the sale, use, transportation, storage and disposal of pesticides in Ontario.<sup>21,22</sup> Since we were applying glyphosate and linuron to our trials, we had to make sure we were working appropriately under the exemptions for the use of these pesticides for scientific purposes.  

The linuron we are using falls under [Class 4](https://www.ontario.ca/page/class-4-pesticides) of _Regulation 63/09_.<sup>23,24</sup> [Section 9](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/090063#BK18) of _Regulation 63/09_ outlines the pesticides that are prohibited; it states that registered pesticides under class 4 are not part of the group of prohibited pesticides.<sup>22</sup> In a similar manner, the glyphosate we are using falls under [Class 7](https://www.ontario.ca/page/class-7-pesticides) of _Regulation 63/09_ and is not part of the group of prohibited pesticides as outlined by [Section 9](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/090063#BK18), as well.<sup>22,23,25</sup>

# Microbe Regulation

Image sourced from Grist

Part of our project was to understand whether or not a genetically altered organism could be realistically applied and used in Canadian agriculture. To assess whether we could realistically expect our product to be used for agricultural purposes, we corresponded with the office of the _Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs_. Our altered Rhizobia falls under national pesticide regulations, specifically under the regulations set in place by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. The regulatory directive [Guidelines for the Registration of Microbial Pest Control Agents and Products](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/reports-publications/pesticides-pest-management/policies-guidelines/regulatory-directive/2001/registration-microbial-pest-control-agents-products-dir2001-02.html) provides a set of guidelines that encompass important factors.<sup>26</sup> These factors include biological properties, potential pathogenicity, ability to multiply, and determine whether or not a microbial agent is safe to use and is of value for agricultural practices. Under this directive, microbial pest control agents are defined as “naturally occurring or genetically modified microorganisms, including bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa, viruses, mycoplasmae or rickettsiae, and related organisms”, meaning that our genetically altered Rhizobia fall under these regulations.<sup>26</sup>

This regulatory directive was developed in part to be able to support “effective and sustainable pest management and the introduction of new pest management technology” and seeing as our Rhizobia could become a big part of integrated weed management strategies, registering our methods and turning them into legitimate regulated methods is the next step.<sup>26</sup>
	
Registering our _Rhizobia_ would require submitting notable amounts  of information to the _Pest Management Regulatory Agency_ but much of this information has already been gathered by different members of our iGEM team. Information such as Construction of the Recombinant Microorganism, Nature and Expression of Introduced or Modified Genetic Material, Environmental Toxicology, and others.
(INSERT HYPERLINKS HERE)

As stated in the directive, not all microorganisms require the same type of information to be submitted to the _Pest Management Regulatory Agency_. Further work in the following areas would need to be done for the successful registration and implementation of our altered _Rhizobia_:
-Manufacturing Methods and Quality Assurance
-Potency Estimation and Product Guarantee
-Storage Stability Testing
-Food and Feed Residue Studies
-Laboratory Studies on Environmental Fate
  -Pure Culture Testing
  -Microcosm Testing 
-Value Assessment 
-Performance Assessment 
-Laboratory and Growth Chamber Studies
-Compatibility with Crop Protection and Management Strategies 

## Conclusions

Many of the data that needs to be gathered for successful registration and use of our product requires equipment, space and time beyond the scope of our project. We strongly believe that if we had all of this data gathered, our altered Rhizobia would have a strong chance of being accepted and becoming an integral part of integrated weed management strategies in Canadian agriculture.
