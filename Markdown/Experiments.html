<h2 id="mic-assay-design">MIC assay design</h2>
<p>We would like to thank <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/Collaborations#UofW" title="Waterloo 2019 Collaborations">Newcastle iGEM</a>, and specifically Connor, for their support in this area of the project. </p>
<p>MIC assays are used in many areas of microbiology, with applications including evaluation of novel antimicrobial agents (Foerster, 2016). Organisms generally grow faster at lower concentrations of a given toxin, giving a profile as shown in figure 1. The profile’s shape is explained as follows: at concentrations below a critical toxin concentration, the organism is completely uninhibited, allowing it to grow at a maximal rate. At concentration above a critical toxin concentration, the organism is mostly inhibited, resulting in minimal growth. At the critical “minimum inhibitory” concentration, a much steeper transition region exists. The position and steepness of this transition region reflect toxicity: an organism with a higher toxin tolerance </p>
<p><img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/f/f2/T--Waterloo--Fig1.png" alt="Fig1" title="Profile of Microbial Growth Rate Versus Toxin Concentration"></p>
<p>Figure 1 above represents an idealized profile of microbial growth rate versus toxin concentration.</p>
<p>Various MIC formats and methods exist, but we chose to use a 96-well plate format, allowing many toxin concentrations to be evaluated in replicate at the same time. A plate-reading spectrophotometer was then used to measure the bacterial growth in each well using absorbance of light at 600 nm (Abs<sub>600</sub>). </p>
<p>We conducted MIC experiments with both <em>E. coli</em> and <em>B. diazoeffiens</em> and evaluated tolerance toward both linuron and 3,4-DCA. </p>
<p>We used a combination of approaches to evaluate growth, measuring Abs<sub>600</sub> at a single timepoint for some experiments and Abs<sub>600</sub> over time for other experiments to calculate growth rate. Single-timepoint MICs are much more convenient to perform, and show a snapshot of growth represented as Abs<sub>600</sub> vs concentration. This is sufficient for some purposes, but fails to take into account the overall growth characteristics of a each bacterial population, especially when different strains or species are being compared. For example, two bacterial strains may have the same growth rate during exponential phase, but if one had a slightly longer lag phase, its Abs<sub>600</sub> will appear lower at a given point in time, falsely suggesting poorer toxin tolerance. Single timepoint OD values are also affected greatly by small differences in the OD of the added broth culture. Collecting Abs<sub>600</sub> data at several timepoints allows for calculation of growth rate, a much more robust measure of a strain’s ability to grow at a certain toxin concentration.</p>
<p>Timepoints for measuring growth were determined by trial and error, with the goal of taking measurements during mid-log phase. This phase of growth corresponds to the greatest differences between bacterial populations growing at different rates for single readings and provides the best estimation of growth rate if multiple readings are used. For <em>E. coli</em>, single timepoints were taken at 7 hours. For <em>B. diazoefficiens</em>, single timepoints were taken at 24 hours and growth curves from 22-30 hours. </p>
<p>In summary, our MIC protocol involved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow organism of interest in appropriate liquid media to mid-exponential phase, verifying by measuring Abs<sub>600</sub></li>
<li>Prepare a solution of the toxin of interest in the same growth media used for the liquid culture</li>
<li>Prepare serial dilutions of the toxin of interest across the columns of 96-well plate</li>
<li>Add a fixed volume of the mid-exponential phase liquid culture to each well</li>
<li>Incubate the 96-well plate, allowing the organism to grow</li>
<li>Read Abs<sub>600</sub> of each well at one or more timepoints to evaluate growth</li>
</ul>
<p>This is presented in greater detail in the below protocol.</p>

<p>Due to <em>E. coli*’s fast growth rate, we chose to dilute it from overnight culture in LB broth to a target Abs<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 before each experiment. *B. diazoefficiens</em> was allowed to grow for approximately 4 days and 16 hours to an Abs<sub>600</sub> of 0.4-0.6, which is thought to correspond to mid-exponential phase. </p>
<p>Since linuron and 3,4-DCA both have limited water solubility, dissolving directly into LB or TY media was not practical, even at concentrations well below the solubility. Instead, concentrated solutions of linuron and 3,4-DCA were prepared in DMSO (approx. 45 mM and 90 mM respectively), and these were then used to prepare working solutions of 290 µM linuron and 550 µM 3,4-DCA. The very low concentration of DMSO in the solutions was assumed to be of negligible toxicity to the organisms. </p>
<p>The 96-well plate’s border was filled with plain LB or TY broth in order to serve as a barrier to evaporation during incubation and to act as a control for potential contamination.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-mic-data">Analysis of MIC data</h2>
<p>For single-timepoint readings, Abs<sub>600</sub> data were corrected by subtracting the average broth-only blank. </p>
<p>For growth curve experiments, Abs<sub>600</sub> data were plotted versus measurement time in hours and fit with a curve of the form y = ae<sup>kx</sup> + b, where k is growth rate in reciprocal hours. </p>
<p>Abs<sub>600</sub> for growth rate was analysed by plotting versus toxin concentration. A horizontal log scale was used for convenience. The data were then fit using an empirically-chosen 4-parameter sigmoidal curve of the form shown in equation 1 (Tixier, 2002).</p>
<p><img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e6/T--Waterloo--Eq1.png" alt="Eq1"></p>
<p>This was completed using least squares regression in Microsoft Excel Solver. The four parameters serve to summarize the relationship between growth rate or Abs<sub>600</sub> and pesticide concentration. This relationship also allows the calculation of parameters such as inhibitory concentrations, such as IC<sub>50</sub>, IC<sub>10</sub>, or IC<sub>90</sub>, which represent the amounts of toxin required to toxin concentrations required to inhibit 10, 50, or 90 % of growth respectively. Inhibitory concentration at a given level f is calculated from the sigmoidal fit parameters as follows: y<sub>f</sub> = A + B(1 – f), the IC<sub>50</sub> is calculated by substituting y<sub>f</sub> into the four parameter fit above and solving for x, which corresponds to IC<sub>f</sub>.</p>
