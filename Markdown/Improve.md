# Improve: Gold medal criterion #2

To fulfil gold medal criterion #2, our team created a new part, [BBa_K2995002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2995002), which is an improvement of [BBa_K2573000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2573000). 

We improved [BBa_K2573000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2573000) by making the expression of the MetE gene light-inducible in the new part [BBa_K2995002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2995002). 

For more details, visit either/both of those registry pages.
