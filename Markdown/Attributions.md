# Experimental Design and Consultation
Along with the guidance provided by the Waterloo iGEM advisors, faculty and graduate students of the university were consulted, and aided in the development of our design. Thanks go out to Scott Liddycoat, who is a departmental technician in the faculty of science, and who helped us optimize the growing conditions of the soybeans. As well, to the departmental technician Cheryl Soulli√®re who provided a protocol for facilitating nodulation in soybean plants, as conducted for the university labs. 
  Graduate student of Dr. Trevor Charles, Adrian Van Dyke, was of immeasurable help in guiding our team throughout the conjugation protocol, culturing rhizobia, and providing weekly aid and insight.

# Hardware Support 
Large thanks go towards Dr. Josh Neufeld and the Neufeld lab, that allowed our team access to their plate reader, *INSERT MODEL*, Dr. Brain Ingalls for allowing use of the flow-cytometer, and Dr. Trevor Charles for the platereader *INSERT MODEL*. 

# Human Practices
We would like to thank the following people for taking time out of their day to help us better understand the implications and implementations of our project. Thank you to Dr. Breanne Tidemann and Dr. Sara Martin of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada who helped us learn the typical views on herbicides from the general public, barriers to communicating agriculture practices, and potential ways to overcome them. As well, thanks to Steven Fekete of Fekete Farms and Karl Gmach from Gmach Gardens for speaking with us about their farming practices, including fertilizer and herbicide use, and communicated potential concerns from their consumers about our project. Finally, thank you to Phil Nadalin from Bayer Canada for answering our questions concerning current industry standards with using *Rhizobia*, as well as on potential implementation of our project.

*I saw Dylan used something in E7 - does that need to be noted?*
