We would like to give a huge thank you to all the advisors of the Waterloo iGEM Team. They have helped the team immensely over the years and we can not be more grateful. From things like giving feedback on potential projects, troubleshooting, finances, and even networking-- all of the advisors were very helpful.

# Experimental Design and Consultation
Along with the guidance provided by the Waterloo iGEM advisors, faculty and graduate students of the university were consulted, and aided in the development of our design. Thanks go out to Scott Liddycoat, who is a departmental technician in the faculty of science, and who helped us optimize the growing conditions of the soybeans. As well, to the departmental technician Cheryl Soulli√®re who provided a protocol for facilitating nodulation in soybean plants, as conducted for the university labs. 
  Graduate student of Dr. Trevor Charles, Adrian Van Dyke, was of immeasurable help in guiding our team throughout the conjugation protocol, culturing rhizobia, and providing weekly aid and insight.

Large thanks go towards the Dr. Josh Neufeld and the Neufeld lab, that allowed our team access to their plate reader, *INSERT MODEL*, Dr. Brain Ingalls for allowing use of the flow-cytometer, and Dr. Trevor Charles for the platereader *INSERT MODEL*. 

*I saw Dylan used something in E7 - does that need to be noted?*
